        <p>
            LungPredict is an AI-powered solution designed to assist in early detection of lung diseases. 
            Leveraging advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN), it can analyze uploaded chest X-ray 
            images to predict potential lung conditions. This project aims to support healthcare 
            professionals and individuals in making informed decisions about lung health by offering 
            fast and accurate predictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the integrated chatbot can answer questions related to lung diseases, helping 
            users understand symptoms, prevention, and treatment options. By combining image-based 
            prediction and conversational AI, LungPredict strives to bridge the gap between technology 
            and healthcare for better outcomes.
